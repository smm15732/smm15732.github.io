  <p>My name Samantha Maritza Manzano. Let me tell you a little about myself... 
  What do i want to do once i finish high school? 
I honestly want to go to the army  I’ve second guessed and thought about going to college but i just don’t think college is for me. While I’m still in high school i want to join a military school so i can be prepared for the army. Why i want to join the army? I want to join the army so I can start off with a good start In life & I want to serve my country </p>
<p> What are some strengths that i have? 
I have integrity and perseverance. In Computer Science, we had an assignment where we had to create a website and we had tasks to complete  I didn’t give up, what I struggled the most on was my home page because of the CSS coding complictaions and as you can see I perservered and successed on my home page in the previous page 
Some major accomplishments that i  accomplished would have to be when i was one of the 20 students to chosen to be a WE LEADERS in 7th and 8th grade. I participated in this club called WE LEADERS and what we did was basically make food drives and recycle.I did community hours and by the end of the year we got to go this concert called WE DAY. There would be famous people giving speeches about making a change in the world.

I Samantha Maritza Manzano Alfaro want to join the army as soon as I graduate high school and attend for 4 years. I want my mom to be proud of me everything i do is for her and my mom is the strongest women i know. Anywho my favorite sport is basketball. Playing basketball honestly is a way I can calm down and have fun. My favorite food would have to be fries, like I can eat fries with anything. I am the oldest sibling out of 5, I want to really be successful and remembered when i die. I am so determined to be the first in my moms part of the family to be a high school graduate and get my diploma.Something that I have learned about myself is that I amoutgoing i am an over hyped person. Like in basketball I don’t give up i persevered.
